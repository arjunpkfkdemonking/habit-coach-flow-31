# 🏋️‍♂️ Elitra Fitness Tracker

**Live demo:** [fitnesstrackercom.netlify.app](https://fitnesstrackercom.netlify.app/)  
**Team:** *Elitra*  
**AI Co-pilot used:** *Lovable* — a GPT-5 powered product design assistant.

---

## 💡 Overview
**Elitra Fitness Tracker** is a next-generation web app that blends **habit tracking**, **AI-driven coaching**, and **motivational psychology** to help users build their ideal physique — sustainably and intelligently.

Users set personal goals, track daily habits, and visualize progress through adaptive dashboards and streak-based gamification. The built-in **AI Coach** delivers personalized insights, reminders, and encouragement based on user behavior and preferences.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Goal Setting:** Define target physique, weight, or strength goals.
- **Visual Progress:** Side-by-side *current vs. ideal physique* visualizer.
- **Journey Graphs:** Track body metrics, habit streaks, and milestones over time.
- **AI Coach:** Adaptive motivational chatbot using behavioral psychology.
- **Gamified Streaks:**  
  - One missed day per month forgiven.  
  - Two consecutive inactive days → streak reset.  
  - Earn XP, badges, and rewards for consistency.
- **Privacy First:** All photos and metrics are private by default.
- **Responsive Design:** Built for mobile-first use with dark-mode elegance.

---

## 🧠 Motivation
Fitness apps often fade from user attention due to low engagement and unclear progress feedback.  
**Elitra** keeps motivation alive through:
- Immediate feedback loops (visual + emotional).
- Ethical behavioral nudges (“psyops” done right).
- Personal tone adaptation — your coach learns *how you like to be motivated.*

##  pronpt

I’m building a simple full-stack project called **Habitify** — a Habit Tracker & Life Progress app that simplifies daily habit tracking.

Requirements:
- Must work on both **mobile and web** (Progressive Web App – PWA).
- Use **React + TailwindCSS** for the frontend.
- Use **Firebase (Auth + Firestore)** or **localStorage** for data.
- Include habit creation, completion tracking by date, streaks, and archiving.
- Save progress offline first, sync later (Firebase optional).
- Elegant dark UI with pink highlights (modern look).
- Should be easy to run with:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev



### Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/elitra/fitness-tracker.git

# 2. Move into the folder
cd fitness-tracker

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Run the app
npm start
